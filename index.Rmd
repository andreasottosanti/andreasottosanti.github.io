I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Statistical Sciences, currently working at the homonymous department of the University of Padova (Italy).  
My research interests are prevalently focused on methods for clustering based on probability distributions (model-based clustering) both in the Frequentist and in the Bayesian paradigms, with particular emphasis to the applications in genomics and astronomy.
