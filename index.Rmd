I am an Assistant Professor (Tenure-Track Researcher) of Statistics at the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova (Italy). 
My research interests are prevalently focused on developing clustering methods based on probability distributions (model-based clustering) both in the Frequentist and in the Bayesian paradigms, with particular emphasis to the applications in genomics and astronomy.
